### Where is the normal README for this repository?

In 2021, I began creating dedicated /Documentation branches in the repositories I have forked in Github, in order to better document why I forked that repository and what work I had done or intended to do in it.

In order to see the official readme, please switch to the master branch.

### Why Did I Fork This Repository?

TweetSharp was a library for the Twitter API, for use in the C# language.

At some point, its maintainer and author decided to stop maintaining the library, and after some attempts to commercialize or hand off the project, chose to remove the official repository from Github entirely.

At the point in which the official repository was removed from Github, I was still aware of multiple individuals and clients who were utilizing the API for various projects.

Since it appeared (and still appears) that I have the most up to date version of this repository on Github, I host it here for historical purposes, and so something will appear in Google search results for what was once a popular library, and is still available on Nuget.

This code should not be used to connect to the Twitter API, and is far out of date with the current version of any APIs Twitter offers.

### Personal Contributions to The Repository

The branch feature/patch-rate-limiting is a patch I made to this repository in 2014, that updated the base repository to handle changes Twitter made to its Rate Limiting API at the time.

This was the latest version of the repository that I had locally upon learning that it had been taken down from Github.
